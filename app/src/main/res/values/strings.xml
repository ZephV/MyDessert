    <string name="Cakes">Cakes are sweet tender breads made with sugar and delicate flour. Cakes can vary from light, airy sponge cakes to dense cakes with less flour.  Common flavourings include dried, candied or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa or extracts. They may be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like  pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit. Cake is often served as a  celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, for example weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. Small-sized cakes have become popular, in the  form of cupcakes and petits fours.</string>
    <string name="Chocolates_and_candies">Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown, food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted, ground, and often flavored. Pure,  unsweetened chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate currently consumed is in  the form of sweet chocolate, combining chocolate with sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or  condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and  sugar to the cacao mixture, with no milk or much less than milk chocolate.</string>
    <string name="Cookies_or_biscuits">Cookies, (from the Dutch word koekje meaning little cake), also known as \"biscuits\" in many English-speaking countries, are flattish bite-sized  or larger short pastries generally intended to be eaten out of the hand. Cookies can have a texture that is crispy, chewy, or soft. Examples include  layered bars, crispy meringues, and soft chocolate chip cookies.</string>
    <string name="Custards_and_puddings">These kinds of desserts usually include a thickened dairy base. Custards are cooked and thickened with eggs. Baked custards include crème brûl ée and flan. Puddings are thickened with starches such as cornstarch or tapioca. Custards and puddings are often used as ingredients in other  desserts, for instance as a filling for pastries or pies.</string>
    <string name="Deep_fried_desserts">Many cuisines include a dessert made of deep-fried starch-based batter or dough. In many countries a doughnut is a flour-based batter that has  been deep-fried. It is sometimes filled with custard or jelly. Fritters are fruit pieces in a thick batter that have been deep fried. Gulab jamun is an  Indian dessert made of milk solids kneaded into a dough, deep-fried, and soaked in honey. Churros are a deep-fried and sugared dough that is  eaten as dessert or a snack in many countries.</string>
    <string name="Frozen_desserts">Ice cream, gelato, sorbet and shaved-ice desserts fit into this category. Ice cream is a cream base that is churned as it is frozen to create a creamy  consistency. Gelato uses a milk base and has less air whipped in than ice cream, making it denser. Sorbet is made from churned fruit and is not  dairy based. Shaved-ice desserts are made by shaving a block of ice and adding flavored syrup or juice to the ice shavings.</string>
    <string name="Jellied_desserts">Jellied desserts are made with a sweetened liquid thickened with gelatin or another thickening agent. They are traditional in many cultures.  Grass jelly and annin tofu are Chinese jellied desserts. Yōkan is a Japanese jellied dessert. In English-speaking countries, many dessert recipes are  based on gelatin with fruit or whipped cream added.</string>
    <string name="Pastries">Pastries are sweet baked pastry products. Pastries can either take the form of light and flaky bread with an airy texture, such as a croissant or  unleavened dough with a high fat content and crispy texture, such as shortbread. Pastries are often flavored or filled with fruits, chocolate, nuts,  and spices. Pastries are sometimes eaten with tea or coffee as a breakfast food.</string>
    <string name="Pies_cobblers_and_clafoutis">Pies and cobblers are a crust with a filling. The crust can be either made from either a pastry or crumbs. Pie fillings range from fruits to puddings;  cobbler fillings are generally fruit-based. Clafoutis are a batter with fruit-based filling poured over the top before baking.</string>
    <string name="Sweet_soups">Tong sui, literally translated as \"sugar water\" and also known as tim tong, is a collective term for any sweet, warm soup or custard served as a  dessert at the end of a meal in Cantonese cuisine. Tong sui are a Cantonese specialty and are rarely found in other regional cuisines of China.  Outside of Cantonese-speaking communities, soupy desserts generally are not recognized as a distinct category, and the term tong sui is not  used.</string>
    <string name="Dessert_wines">Dessert wines are sweet wines typically served with dessert. There is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered  to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the  red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less  strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Ximénez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the  United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all fortified wines - and is  taxed more highly as a result. Examples include Sauternes and Tokaji Aszú.</string>
    <string name="Dessert">Dessert (/dᵻˈzɜːrt/) is a course that concludes a main meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods and beverages, such as dessert wine or liqueurs, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. In some parts of the world,such as much of central and western Africa, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.             \"The term \\\"dessert\\\" can apply to many confections, such as cakes, tarts, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet soups. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.             \"The word \\\"dessert\\\" originated from the French word desservir, meaning \\\"to clear the table.\\\" Its first known use was in 1600, in a health education manual entitled Naturall and artificial Directions for Health, which was written by William Vaughan. In his A History of Dessert (2013), Michael Krondl explains it refers to the fact dessert was served after the table had been cleared of other dishes. The term dates from the 14th century but attained its current meaning around the beginning of the 20th century when \\\"service à la française\\\" (setting a variety of dishes on the table at the same time) was replaced with \\\"service à la russe\\\" (presenting a meal in courses.)\\\"\";</string>
